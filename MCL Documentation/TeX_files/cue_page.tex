 \chapter{Cue Page:}
 \textit{Cue Page functionality when Chain Mode is enabled is currently experimental}\\
 The Cue Page is used to send the audio of a specific track to the Audio Cue output. The audio cue output is Audio Output F on the MD.\\
 \\
 The CUE Page can be used in one of two ways. As an alternative to the MD Mute menu. Cued tracks are muted on the Master Output. Or as a way to preview tracks before they are played on the MD Master output, much like cueing a track on a traditional DJ mixer.\\
\\Tracks with audio routed to the AudioCue output are denoted with an X as depicted below.\\

 \textit{The Cue Page is accessible from the PageSelect page.}
  \subsection{Encoder Assignment:}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 1 ]: } --
 	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 2 ]: } --
 	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 3 ]: } Quantization
 	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 4 ]: } --
 \end{itemize}
 The Trigger Interface is used to interact with CUE Page. Pressing a MD trigger will toggle the CUE output of the corresponding track.
 
 \subsection{Quantization Modes:}
 Quantization modes are used to control the behaviour of the cue operations and allow for cue events to be musically timed.\\
 \\
 When a numerical quantization value is chosen the selected trackâ€™s cue will be toggled on the next specified multiple of the step-count.
 \begin{itemize}
\item --: Write tracks to current pattern as soon as possible, no muting.
\item 02: Toggle cue on next possible 2nd step
\item 04: Toggle cue on next possible 4th step
\item 08: Toggle cue on next possible 8th step 
\item 16: Toggle cue on next possible 16th step 
\item 32: Toggle cue on next possible 32th step 
\item 64: Toggle cue on next possible 64th step
\item LV: Set volume of selected tracks to 0 and toggle cue.
 \end{itemize}
