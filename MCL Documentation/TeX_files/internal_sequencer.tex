\chapter{Internal Sequencer:}
MCL features a powerful 20 track internal sequencer. There are 16 tracks dedicated to the MD and 4 tracks dedicated to the Analog 4 or an External Midi device.
\paragraph{MD Sequencer Tracks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 16 Track Sequencer with independent track lengths (64 max steps).
\item Conditional Trigs and Micro Timing per step (10 degrees left or right of centre.)
\item 4 lockable parameters per track with 64 locks per parameter. Lockable parameters are MIDI learnt and recordable from the MD.
\item Trigless Locks.
\item Real time record for both step and lock data.
Chromatic Mode. (Machine pitch values are chromatically mapped to the MD. Melodies are recordable)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{A4 or ExtMIDI Sequencer tracks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 x 4-Note Polyphonic On-Off sequencer tracks. Each track can run in either high or low resolution modes. 
\item Each track transmits on MIDI-OUT2, Midi channel = Track Numbers 1 to 6.
\item Conditional Trigs and MicroTiming (6 degrees for high res, 10 degrees for low res)
\item Low resolution mode up to 128 steps per track,
\item High resolution mode up to 64 steps per track with the ability trigger successive 16th notes.
\item Chromatics Mode with selectable scales.
\item Legato record
\end{itemize}
The internal sequencer is synced to the MIDIClock source.

\section{Internal Sequencer: Loading and Saving}
Internal sequencer tracks are linked to the slot positions in the Grid.\\
\\
When storing a track within the Save menu, the internal sequencer data for that track is stored along with the track data in the specified slot.\\
\\
Internal Sequencer tracks are loaded when tracks are sent to the MD or A4 in the Write page.

\section{Internal Sequencer Pages:}
\textit{The primary Sequencer Pages are accessed using [\textbf{Encoder Buttons (1-4)].} Each sequencer page has access to secondary pages accessible by pressing \textbf{[Save]}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Encoder 1: MD Step edit                          [ A4 Step edit ]
