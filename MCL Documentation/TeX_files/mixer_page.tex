\chapter{Mixer Page:}
The mixer page displays the audio levels, or parameter values of the sixteen MD tracks of the current Kit.

The trigger interface is used in conjunction with \textbf{[ Encoder 1]} to raise or lower the volume of multiple tracks simultaneously. The remaining encoders can be used to adjust the filter parameters of the selected tracks.
