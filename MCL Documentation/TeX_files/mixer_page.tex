\chapter{Mixer Page:}
The mixer page displays the audio levels, or parameter values of the sixteen MD tracks of the current Kit.
\\
The trigger interface is used in conjunction with \textbf{[ Encoder 1]} to raise or lower the volume of multiple tracks simultaneously. The remaining encoders can be used to adjust the filter parameters of the selected tracks. The Machinedrum encoders can be used to manipulate any specific parameter across selected tracks, similar to the MD's built in CTRL-ALL functionality.

\section{Audio Mutes}

The top row of mixer page shows the Audio Mute state of each Track. The audio mute state changes the audio routing of muted tracks. When a track is muted from the Mixer Page, audio is routed to the Audio Output specified on the Route Page.\\
\\
\textit{Audio mutes are independent from the MD's sequencer mute page.}

\subsection{Mute Tracks}
Holding down \textbf{[ Chain ]} and pressing a trigger buttons on the MD allows you to quickly toggle the mute state of a track.
\subsection{Solo Tracks}
Holding down \textbf{[ Save ]} and pressing the trigger buttons on the MD allows you to quickly solo selected tracks.
\subsection{Recall Tracks}
When entering the Mixer page, a snapshot will be taken for all track parameters including Level, FLTF, FLTW and FLTQ.
Holding down \textbf{[Shift2]} and pressing the trigger buttons on the MD recalls the parameter settings for the selected track.
