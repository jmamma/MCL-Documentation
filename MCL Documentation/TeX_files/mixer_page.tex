\chapter{Mixer Page:}
The mixer page graphically illustrates the audio  levels of the sixteen MD tracks of the current Kit.\\
\\
The trigger interface is used in conjunction with \textbf{[ Encoder 1]} to raise or lower the volume of multiple tracks simultaneously. The remaining encoders can be used to adjust the filter parameters of the selected tracks. \\

\textit{The Mixer Page is accessible from the PageSelect page.}
\section{Encoder Assignment:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 1 ]: } Level
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 2 ]: } FLTF (Filter Frequency)
    \item \textbf{[ Encoder 3 ]: } FLTW (Filter width)
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 4 ]: } FLTQ (Filter resonance)
\end{itemize}


\section{Audio Mutes}
The top row of mixer page shows the Audio Mute state of each Track. The audio mute state changes the audio routing of muted tracks. When a track is muted from the Mixer Page, audio is routed to the Audio Output specified on the Route Page.\\
\\
\textit{Audio mutes are independent from the MD's sequencer mute page} \\
