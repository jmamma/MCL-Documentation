\chapter{Chain Page}
The chain page is used to load slots from the Grid. When a slot is loaded, Machine/Sound data is sent to the attached device and the internal sequencer data for that track is loaded.

If the sequencer is stopped the selected slots will be loaded immediately. If the sequencer is running the slots will be placed in the transition queue, to be loaded at the next interval defined by the selected quantization rule.

\textit{The Chain Page is accessible from the GridPage by pressing the  \textbf{[Write | Chain]} function button.}

\section{Chain invidiual tracks:}
Tracks can be placed in the transition queue, to be loaded at the next specified Quantization interval. To do so, simply press and release the corresponding trigger buttons in the Chain Page.
\section{Chain a pattern/row:}
From within the Chain Page, pressing \textbf{[Shift2]} will chain an entire row/pattern consisting of all 16 MD tracks + 4 A4/Ext tracks.\\
\\
\textit{Note: If sequencer playback is stopped, tracks will be loaded immediately. When chaining an entire row, the current Kit will be replaced and master FX settings loaded.}

\section{Quantization Rules}
The quantization rules specify the transition interval for the selected slots.\\
\\
The minimum Quantization value is 4 steps. Quantization values can be changed by adjusting the "Q:" parameter and increase in powers of 2.\\
