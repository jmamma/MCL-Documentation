\chapter{Loudness Page}
Gain staging and matching loudness levels between patterns on the MD can be a complicated issue.

\textit{The Loudness Page is accessible from the PageSelect page.}

As a general rule of thumb, the track LEV parameter should control the absolute volume of a track; the VOL parameter should be used to control relative level to other tracks. This allows setting a sound level to its maximum by turning the LEV paramater to 127, and not unexpectedly exceed it.\\
\\
When working on different kits you can end up with completely different loudness levels, depending on your style of programming and the configuration of master effects.

\section{Gain Boost:}
The ability to boost / reduce the VOL of all tracks in the current kit by a percentage amount.
\\Pressing any of the encoder buttons will apply the boost/reduction.
