\chapter{Loudness Page}
Gain staging and loudness levels on the MD have always been an issue.

When working on different kits you can end up with completely different loudness levels, depending on your style of programming and the configuration of master effects.

The new firmware features a Loudness page with 3 functions that attempts to address this.

Functions:

**Track Level Normalise:** When activated,  all track levels have their LEV boosted to 127, and parameters controlling VOL (including parameter locks) are lowered to compensate. 

The resulting track loudness remains the same, but the Track LEV parameter is no longer set arbitrarily. LEV == 127 will always be the loudest volume for a track.

Gain Boost:

The ability to boost / reduce the VOL of all tracks in the current kit by a percentage amount.

Peak Analyser.

The MD is instructed to record 1 Bar of the current pattern. The recording is transferred to the MegaCommand and the WAV file is decoded and analysed. The peak value in the recording is found and this is used to determine an appropriate gain boost to increase pattern/kit loudness using the Boost function above.
