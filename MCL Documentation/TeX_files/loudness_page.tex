\chapter{Loudness Page}
Gain staging and matching loudness levels between patterns on the MD can be a complicated task.

\textit{The Loudness Page is accessible from the PageSelect page.}

As a general rule of thumb, the track LEV parameter should control the absolute volume of a track whilst the VOL parameter should be used to control the relative level. This allows setting a sound level to its maximum loudness by turning the LEV parameter to 127.\\
\\
When working on different kits you can end up with completely different loudness levels, depending on your style of programming and the configuration of master effects.
