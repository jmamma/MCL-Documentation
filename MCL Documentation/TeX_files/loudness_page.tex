\chapter{Loudness Page}
Gain staging and matching loudness levels between patterns on the MD can be a complicated issue.\\
\\
As a general rule of thumb, the track LEV parameter should control the absolute volume of a track; the VOL parameter should be used to control relative level to other tracks. This allows setting a sound level to its maximum by turning the LEV paramater to 127, and not unexpectedly exceed it.\\
\\
When working on different kits you can end up with completely different loudness levels, depending on your style of programming and the configuration of master effects.\\\\

\section{Encoder Assignment:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 1 ]: } Gain adjustment
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 2 ]: } -
    \item \textbf{[ Encoder 3 ]: } -
	\item \textbf{[ Encoder 4 ]: } -
\end{itemize}

\section{Gain Boost:}
The ability to boost / reduce the VOL of all tracks in the current kit by a percentage amount.
\\Pressing any of the encoder buttons will apply the boost/reduction.

\section{Peak Analyser.}
\textbf{[Save]}\\\\
The MD is instructed to record 1 Bar of the current pattern. The recording is transferred to the MegaCommand and the WAV file is decoded and analysed. The peak value in the recording is found and this is used to determine an appropriate gain boost to increase pattern/kit loudness using the Boost function above.
