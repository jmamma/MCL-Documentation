\textit{To open the voice select page:\\\\
Enter \textbf{GlobalSettings-->MD-->POLY CONFIG}. Or press \textbf{[Save]} + \textbf{[Write]} from  Chromatic Page}

\section{Voice modes}

The Machinedrum's current active track will be used as a monophonic voice from the PTC page.\\
\\
If the current active track is part of the Polyphonic track selection \textbf{POLY} mode will be activated; the MD will be played polyphonically using voices selected from the \textbf{POLY Page.}\\
\\
When POLY mode is active, tracks become 'linked'. Track length and parameter changes will be synchronised across the voices. In addition pressing \textbf{Write} from the PTC Page will clear all recorded sequencer data from the poly tracks.

\section{External MIDI Control}
The MD can be played chromatically using an attached MIDI keyboard/sequencer connected to MIDI input port 2.
To enable/disable control from an external device you must change the Megacommand's \textbf{Global Settings->Machinedrum->CTRL CHAN} setting from INT (internal) to a desired MIDI channel or OMNI (all channels).\\
\\
When external control mode is enabled, the trigger interface will be disabled.\\
\\
You can control the voice parameters using MIDI CC messages. CC 16 to 39 control MD parameters 1 to 24 on the active track, or across all polyphonic tracks.
