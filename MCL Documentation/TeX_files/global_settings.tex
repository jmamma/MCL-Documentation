\section{Convert Project:}
Version 2.X projects can be converted to the 3.X format using the "CONVERT PROJECT"
menu option in Global Settings. Project conversion is non-destructive, your original 2.X
files will remain in the root directory of the SD Card.\\

When initiated, project conversion will create a new project sub-directory on the SD Card under \textbackslash Projects\textbackslash. It will then create the necessary project files and then migrate the 2.X data across.\\\\
\textit{Projects created in version 3.X are not compatible with earlier version of MCL.}
\section{Project Files:}
In 3.0 new and converted projects are now stored in the /Projects/ directory.
Each project has its own folder, inside the project folder there are 3 files:
\begin{verbatim}
\Projects\new_project_000\
                          |- new_project_000.mcl   <- Project master file
                          |- new_project_000.0     <- Grid A data
                          |- new_project_000.1     <- Grid B data
\end{verbatim}
