\chapter{MD Realtime Record Page:}

The RTRK Page is used to record tracks in real-time. If the sequencer is running, trigger presses on the MD will be recorded.

Thanks to micro-timing, trigger presses are recorded at 1/192th note resolution and have a much more organic feel than the MDâ€™s real-time record mode.

\textit{To enter RTRK Page: First select desired track on the MD \textbf{[Function + Track N]}. Then press \textbf{[PageSelect + Trigger 6]}.}

When in RTRK Page, the current sequencer Track will automatically change according to the track corresponding to the last MD Trigger pressed.\\
\\To minimise record latency the display is prevented from updating unless a GUI action occurs.
