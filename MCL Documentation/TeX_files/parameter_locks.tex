\chapter{Parameter Locks:}
The internal sequencer implements parameter locks for the 16 MD tracks. Each of these track has access to 4 Parameter Locks, with 64 steps per lock. Trigless locks are supported, meaning parameter values can change without retriggering the sound. \\\\Unique characters are used to represent the types of locks and are discussed below.
