\chapter{Key Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
\item Page:
\\
The MCL firmware consists of pages accessible through the MC's GUI. Each page contains unique behaviour and is described in this manual.
\item Project:
\\
A project stored on the Micro SD-Card. Each project contains one Grid. 
The maximum number of projects is only limited by the SD Card capacity.

\item Grid:
\\
The MCL Firmware uses a Grid/Slot system to store Tracks. 
The grid dimensions are 128 Rows x 20 Slots. 

\item Row/Pattern:
\\
A row of the Grid. Each row consists of 20 slots and can store 16 Machinedrum tracks and 4 external sequencer or A4 tracks. 

\item Slot:
\\
A position in the Grid where a Track can be stored. (Either occupied or unoccupied).

\item Tracks
\\
A track retrieved from the Elektron MD or AnalogFour, or an external MIDI track.

There are 3 types of tracks.
\begin{itemize}

\item MachineDrum Track (Slots 0-15):

A sequencer track for the Elektron MD. Each MD Track contains the Machine's Sound Settings, Master Effects Settings and Internal Sequencer Data.

\item AnalogFour Track (Slots 16-19):

A sequencer track for the Elektron A4. Each A4 Track contains the  Sound Settinggs and Internal Sequencer Data.
\item Ext Track (Slots 16-19):

A General MIDI device track only containing Local Sequencer Data.
\end{itemize}

\item Internal Sequencer:\\
MCL's built in 20 track internal sequencer used to sequence external MIDI devices such as the Elektron MD and A4.
