\chapter{Key Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
\item Page:
\\
The MCL firmware consists of pages accessible through the MC's function and encoder buttons. Each page contains unique behaviour and is described in this manual.
\item Project:
\\
A project stored on the Micro SD-Card. Each project contains one Grid. 
The maximum number of projects is only limited by the SD Card capacity.

\item Grid:
\\
The MCL Firmware uses a Grid/Slot system to store Tracks. 
The grid dimensions are 128 Rows x 20 Slots. 

\item Row/Pattern:
\\
A row of the Grid. Each row consists of 20 slots and can store 16 MD tracks, a complete MD pattern + 4 external sequencer or A4 tracks.

\item Slot:
\\
A position in the Grid where a Track can be stored. (Either occupied or unoccupied).

\item Tracks
\\
A track copied from the Elektron MD or Analog4, or an external MIDI track.

There are 3 types of tracks.
\begin{itemize}

\item MachineDrum Track (Slots 0-15):\\
