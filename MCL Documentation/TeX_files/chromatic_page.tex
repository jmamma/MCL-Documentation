\chapter{Chromatic Page:}
The Chromatic Page, enables the user to play tracks of the Machinedrum or an Ext MIDI device chromatically. Each MD track can be used as a voice of a monophonic/polyphonic synthesizer. Melodies can be recorded in real-time.

\textit{The Chromatic page can be accessed by pressing \textbf{[ PageSelect ]} and \textbf{[ Trigger 8 ]}.}

\section{Using the Chromatic Page:}

The top left of the screen shows the active device tab and indicates whether the Chromatic Page is targeting the MD or an Ext MIDI device.
The Octave (OCT) parameter allows for adjusting the relative octave of the track's tuning. The Detune (DET) parameter can be used for offsetting the absolute pitch by small increments (MD only). Length (LEN) controls the length of the associated sequencer track. Scale (SCA) maps MIDI notes to a musical scale type.
A keyboard at the bottom of the screen is displayed showing notes as they are played.
\section{Tuning}
For MD tracks hosting a supported machine, the machinesâ€™s pitch is tuned to notes of a selected scale. The track can then be played using the MD Trigger interface or an attached MIDI keyboard.\\\\
The Machinedrum X.04 OS allows for more precise tuning of machines. If the machine's tuning setting is TONAL then the new quarter tone, equal temperament tuning table will be used. If the machine's tuning setting is DEFAULT the legacy microtonal tuning table is used.

\section{Ext MIDI Tracks:}
The Chromatic Page is also used to record/play the External MIDI tracks.
Octave and Scale settings from the Chromatic Page are also applied to incoming note data when using the PianoRoll editor.
\section{Recording a sequence:}
\textit{Press the \textbf{[ Save ] }button to enable record mode, RPTC.\\}

Play notes on either the MD or A4/ExtMidi to record a melody.

\section{Clearing recorded sequence:}
\begin{itemize}
\item To clear the current track, press and hold the\textbf{ [ Shift2 ]} to open the track menu, rotate \textbf{[ Encoder2 ]} to the entry \textbf{CLEAR}, then rotate \textbf{[ Encoder1 ]} to select \textbf{TRK}.
\item To clear all tracks of the current track type, select \textbf{ALL}.
\item The current track can also be quickly cleared by pressing \textbf{[ Load ]}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changing track length:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Track length is controlled by rotating \textbf{[ Encoder 3 ]}.
\item To change the lengths of all tracks of the current track type, simultaneously hold down \textbf{[ Load ]} whilst rotating \textbf{[ Encoder 3 ]}.
\item Track length can also be set by holding \textbf{[ Load ]} and then selecting the corresponding step from the MD trigger interface. The track length is offset by the current track-page.
\end{itemize}


\section{ExtMidi}
Melodies and chords can be played and recorded from an ExtMIDI device on port 2.
\\

When MIDI note data is received, MCL will switch to the first ExtMIDI track that has the same MIDI channel.
\\

\textit{The active device tab will switch over from MD to A4/MI, in the left information panel, when such midi notes are received.}
\\

Switching Between Low and High Resolution Modes on Poly Sequencer Tracks.
Press \textbf{[ Shift2 ]} then rotate \textbf{[ Encoder2 ]} to select the \textbf{TRACK RES.} entry.
