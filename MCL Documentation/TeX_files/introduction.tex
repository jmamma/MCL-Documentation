\section{Hello}
Welcome to MegaCommand Live, 
\\
\\
MegaCommand Live (MCL) is a firmware designed for the MegaCommand MIDI controller that enhances the Elektron MachineDrum's (MD) sequencing, sound design and live performance capabilities.
\\
\\
At the heart of MCL lies the ability to copy individual Tracks from the MD and store them on the MegaCommand (MC) for later recall. Chain Mode, inspired by classic music trackers, allows multiple tracks to be linked together to form complex musical pharses. During a performance, tracks from different patterns can be loaded and mixed together
\\
\\
MCL features a modern sequencer replacement for the Elektron Machinedrum. It consists of 20 local sequencer tracks with individual track lengths, parameter locks, micro-timing and conditional trigs. Sixteen of these tracks can be used to sequence the Elektron MD, the remaining four tracks are polyphonic and can be used to sequence external instruments such as the Elektron Analog 4. 
\\
\\
Other features of the MCL firmware include: MD Trigger Interface, Chromatic + Polyphonic Mode,  Level Mixer, Mute + Cue System, Single Cycle Waveform Designer, Turbo 8x MIDI and much more.
